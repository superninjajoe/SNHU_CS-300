# SNHU_CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

-I looked into the pro and con of different data models. (Binary trees, Hash Tables, Linked Lists). I went over their pro's and con's of each time.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

-Trying to fully understand each data structure and when the appropriate time to apply each. These data model is not a blanket and one is better than the other. Each are a case by case basis.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

-As a not very experience coder, I had to look up many different resources. I had to practice and teach myself. For the data models, I look up different cases for use, and best practice. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

-There is a lot more to coding and design that is required outside of project management. I honestly though with some project management coder just got to work after viewing some psuedocode. I found the important of well written psuedocode.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

-Like with any skill, it requires practice. I have much more practice and I plan on continuing to practice. I would to write better psuedocode since learning the significances of it during this course.
